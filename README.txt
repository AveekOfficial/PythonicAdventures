#Legal and Ethical Considerations
#Before using or distributing this tool, it is important to consider the legal and ethical implications of vulnerability scanning:
1. Authorization: Ensure that you have proper authorization before scanning any website or system. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and unethical.

2. Responsible Disclosure: If you discover vulnerabilities in a website or system, consider responsible disclosure. Notify the website owner or administrator about the vulnerabilities rather than exploiting them.

3. Compliance: Familiarize yourself with and adhere to relevant laws and regulations, such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the United States, and GDPR in the European Union.

4. Terms of Service: Be aware of and respect the terms of service of the websites you scan. Some websites explicitly prohibit scanning in their terms of use.

5. Privacy: Respect user privacy and data protection laws. Avoid collecting, storing, or sharing sensitive user data without proper consent.
