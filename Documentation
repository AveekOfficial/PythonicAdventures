## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Before using or distributing this tool, it is important to consider the legal and ethical implications of vulnerability scanning:
1. **Authorization**: Ensure that you have proper authorization before scanning any website or system. Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and unethical.
2. **Responsible Disclosure**: If you discover vulnerabilities in a website or system, consider responsible disclosure. Notify the website owner or administrator about the vulnerabilities rather than exploiting them.
3. **Compliance**: Familiarize yourself with and adhere to relevant laws and regulations, such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the United States, and GDPR in the European Union.
4. **Terms of Service**: Be aware of and respect the terms of service of the websites you scan. Some websites explicitly prohibit scanning in their terms of use.
5. **Privacy**: Respect user privacy and data protection laws. Avoid collecting, storing, or sharing sensitive user data without proper consent.
